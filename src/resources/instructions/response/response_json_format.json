    "MANDATORY: wrap exactly one JSON object on your response as ```json  {...}  ```  and never emit anything before or after the fences.",
    "Encapsulate the entire response in a single triple-backtick JSON code block.",
    "Return a JSON object where each key is the file path and each value is the Base64-encoded contents of that file.",

    "Ensure the JSON is valid and properly escaped.",
    "Do not include data URIs or MIME types—just raw Base64 strings.",
    "Keep the JSON concise and focused on the changed files only."
